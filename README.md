# discourse-on-k8s

It's a tool to build discourse on k8s(adapted to apple silicon system or arm chip)
## Why I do this

First, I'm a rookie who's learning [k8s](https://kubernetes.io/) and [discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) without familiar with ruby. Because both are very popular on current tech-world, and some good products are using them, like [tidb-operator](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator) or [AskTUG](https://tidb.net/u/jansu-dev/post/all).  
**Second, Iâ€˜ve build [my blog website](www.dbnest.net) focusing on which tech learning, and wanna find out a way to communicate with others people.**
Third, my website was running on my macbook-pro-m1, It's also a big challange to make discourse run on Apple Silicon system.

So, I made this tool or repo based on reasons above, furthermore, I know how difficult and wasting-time it does, I wanna simplify it for everyone.
